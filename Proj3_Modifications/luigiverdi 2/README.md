# BSP3
BSP3 project: Computational Tools for Music

The application provided in this small package is used to visualize (some out of) the musical structures discussed by Luigi Verdi in his book "Caleidocicli Musicali". It has been developed by a student of mine as final assignment for the "Object Oriented Programming" course at the University of Angers on 2012 and it has been used to compose my "Some small Kaleydos". The terminology described therein has been changed in order to be discussed in a French environment. For an outline of the terminology please refer to the book by Luigi Verdi and to the file "projet.pdf" contained in this archive.

In order to use the software, you need to install "JAVA" on your computer. Once verified you do have  "JAVA", you just need to extract the archive content in a directory, and open a shell session on this directory. Then, just type

javac *.java

on the shell. After this, the Java classes will be created. To execute the program, you need to specify the numbers   of halftones which constitute the intervals between the notes you want to use after the command invoking the "main" java class. For instance, type 

java main 4 3

to visualize details about the major chord.

PLEASE NOTICE that this software has been  developed to be used on Linux and portability is not guaranteed. Please also notice that this software comes with no guarantee. We have experienced, in the newest Ubuntu platform, that from time to time nothing happens when executing the program. If you come across the same experience, just close the existing process and re-type the command in the shell.
